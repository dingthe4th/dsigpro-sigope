Signal Operations in Digital Signal Processing

In main, make sure to edit the variables in the cell you are trying to run.

Say, signal values are [-3 1 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
Make sure that you include the infinite 0 before, and after the signal
which will make it [0 -3 1 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0]
While making this, ensure that you are also editing the time as well,
if you added 0 for both sides, values of range of time will update as well.

Say,
x (signal) = [-3 1 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
time =       [-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7]

Adjusting for the 0 before and after:
new x (signal) = [0 -3 1 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0]
new time =       [-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]

Bugs are expected. Kindly report them lol
